## Assignment 1

Anthony, antenna theory is a rich subject and will require some development of the understanding of E&M waves. I'll suggest that in addition to your review of the literature that you read Ch 9 of Griffiths. We will cover this material, but it won't be until later in the semester. The proposed readings that you have are reaosnable, but only one appears to be a real paper. I think the lecutre notes can help you, but you will need to dig into the literature in more detail. I'd suggest the review article that you have by Balantis as the first reading for Friday. I think you can also find some great articles on antenna theory in the American Journal of Physics. For example, here's two that would be prety helpful, I think:

Good work so far.

* Score: 20/20
