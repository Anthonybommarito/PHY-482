# Feedback on Project Work
## Anthony Bommarito

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Anthony, I think you have started digging into the right literature to support your paper. Your summaries of the papers were high-level, so you will need to really dig into them in detail -- working to understand the mathematics behind the models that are being developed. I'm glad to see that the AJP article on antenna theory helped you, but I would have liked to see a bit more about the model and the details of it in the summary to make clear that you are digesting these models and working to understand them. I know it's early in the project, but it's important to set a good foundation - it will make writing your paper easier. I think next week, I'm going to be looking for a deeper dive into the papers with a bit more detail onw aht the models are and what they mean.

## Assignment 1

Anthony, antenna theory is a rich subject and will require some development of the understanding of E&M waves. I'll suggest that in addition to your review of the literature that you read Ch 9 of Griffiths. We will cover this material, but it won't be until later in the semester. The proposed readings that you have are reaosnable, but only one appears to be a real paper. I think the lecutre notes can help you, but you will need to dig into the literature in more detail. I'd suggest the review article that you have by Balantis as the first reading for Friday. I think you can also find some great articles on antenna theory in the American Journal of Physics. For example, here's two that would be pretty helpful, I think:

Good work so far.
