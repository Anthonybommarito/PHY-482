# Feedback on Project Work
## Anthony Bommarito

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 5

Anthony, I'm glad to see that you have developed the mathematical model for a simple antenna this week. Thanks for reading the feedback. You will need to bring this together with your writing on the theory and applications from your previous submissions to form your paper. One thing that will critical in doing that is organzing everything that you have done so far and deciding how this model you have presented here fits into it all. Additionally, it would be worth putting some figures that describe the model you are presenting (those need not be original if they are referenced). It's important to understand the model from both the mathmematical and conceptual perspective. Great update this week.

## Assignment 4

Anthony, this part of your paper writing is looking good. I think you have a good overview of what is going on, and some level of detail on the advanced aspects of the problem. As you are working your paper up, I would like you to dig into the solutions of simple Antenna problems. I think the details that are going to be needed in your paper will fall out of expanding on the 3rd paragraph in your writeup. I know that you have done some of this, but you cannot treat the whole paper as something that I have been reading all along, you will need to provide some details (which is a recurring piece of feedback I've given) on the theory and some of the simpler models. By details, I mean setup, derivation, etc. Maybe that hasn't been clear. In any event, this is a good framework for your paper and I will be looking for your to expand and deepen it this week.

## Assignment 3

Anthony, I'm glad to see you pulling together a number of resourcs and recognizing what you need to learn more about. I am a little concerned that the level of detail here is still low or rather that the summary still is very much of overview of the material. The review of Griffith's reads (to me) like exactly what is in the chapter with little additional digging. The next homework is going to ask you to summarize your background research and synthesize across it, so I'm really looking here for you to motivate, and discuss the details of antennae theory and not smiply state the facts appearing in your sources.

## Assignment 2

Anthony, I think you have started digging into the right literature to support your paper. Your summaries of the papers were high-level, so you will need to really dig into them in detail -- working to understand the mathematics behind the models that are being developed. I'm glad to see that the AJP article on antenna theory helped you, but I would have liked to see a bit more about the model and the details of it in the summary to make clear that you are digesting these models and working to understand them. I know it's early in the project, but it's important to set a good foundation - it will make writing your paper easier. I think next week, I'm going to be looking for a deeper dive into the papers with a bit more detail on what the models are and what they mean.

## Assignment 1

Anthony, antenna theory is a rich subject and will require some development of the understanding of E&M waves. I'll suggest that in addition to your review of the literature that you read Ch 9 of Griffiths. We will cover this material, but it won't be until later in the semester. The proposed readings that you have are reaosnable, but only one appears to be a real paper. I think the lecutre notes can help you, but you will need to dig into the literature in more detail. I'd suggest the review article that you have by Balantis as the first reading for Friday. I think you can also find some great articles on antenna theory in the American Journal of Physics. For example, here's two that would be pretty helpful, I think:
http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.10027
http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.1975246
Good work so far.
